Proteins are arguably one of the most important component in a living organism. As genes encode biological features, proteins deliver biological functions. One protein can adopt many structural conformations, which is largely determined by mini stable (minimum overall entropy). Yet, three dimensional conformation and flexibility of a protein determine its functionality by allowing different binding property and hence initiating different cascades events. In this study, I will be
