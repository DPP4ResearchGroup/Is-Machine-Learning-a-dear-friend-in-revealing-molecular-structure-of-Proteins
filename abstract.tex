Proteins are arguably one of the most important component in a living organism. As genes encode biological features, proteins deliver biological functions. One protein can adopt many structural conformations, which is largely determined by the minimum overall entropy under that specific sub-cellular environment. Yet, three dimensional conformation and flexibility of a protein determine its functionality by allowing different binding property and hence initiating different cascades events downstream. At molecular level, each protein is composed by several linear polypeptide chains folding in a specific pattern to give that unique three dimetnial shape. Each polypeptide chain is consisited of a distinct amino acids (a total of 20 types in human) in sequence, and remarkbily, the protein folding sequence and final spatial configuration are largely encoded in the polypeptide sequences. Nevertheless, the vast scope of possible spatial oriantation based on a given protein amino acid sequence is almost  In this tudy, I will be
