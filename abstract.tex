Proteins are arguably one of the most important component in a living organism. As genes encode biological features, proteins deliver biological functions. One protein can adopt many structural conformations, which is largely determined by the minimum overall entropy under that specific sub-cellular environment. Yet, three dimensional conformation and flexibility of a protein determine its functionality by allowing different binding property and hence initiating different cascades events downstream. In molecular level, each protein is composed of a linear polypeptide chain various amino acids (a total of 20 types in human) after In this study, I will be
