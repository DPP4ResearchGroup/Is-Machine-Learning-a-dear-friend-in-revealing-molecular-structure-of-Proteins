Proteins are arguably one of the most important component in a living organism. As genes encode biological features, proteins deliver biological functions. One protein can adopt many structural conformations, which is largely determined on sub-cellular environments that most stable (minimum overall entropy). Yet, three dimensional conformation and flexibility of a protein determine its functionality by allowing different binding property and hen    In this study, I will be
